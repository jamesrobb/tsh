# TinyShell

This is for a project called Shell Lab in the Operating Systems class at Reyjavik Univerity. In this project, a tiny shell was implemented that handeled moving jobs to/from the foreground/background and proper handling of SIGINT, SIGTSTP, and SIGCHLD. A job can be stopped by moving sending SIGTSTP to the shell. A stopped job can be started and moved into the foreground/background through the use of of the commands *fg* and *bg*, followed by the process id. Jobs can be viewed with the *jobs* command.

If you are a Reykjavik University student doing this assignment, I would strongly encourage you to not look at this code until you have completed the assignment and the handin deadline has passed.
